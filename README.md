# Objective of Page
I would like to record down how I installed different open-source tools and the open-source PDK here.
I come up an shell script to automate the installation process.  I also included the link to download the VirtualBox image I created.

# VirtualBox and Ubuntu 22.04
To download the image of Ubuntu 22.04, [click here to download it](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=22.04&architecture=amd64).
Simply follow the steps in [this link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview), which enables you to run the Ubuntu Desktop using the VirtualBox.
Please make sure you reserve ~50GB of virtual disk space for the installation of tools and PDK.  I had a hard time of running out disk space during my first installation :(

I did come up an script to automate the installation process.  Since the installation process is long, we must be patient !!
